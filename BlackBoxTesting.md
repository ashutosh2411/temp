# Black Box Testing
**BLACK BOX TESTING**, also known as **Behavioral Testing**, is a software testing method in which the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is not known to the tester. These tests can be functional or non-functional, though usually functional.

This method is named so because the software program, in the eyes of the tester, is like a black box; inside which one cannot see. This method attempts to find errors in the following categories:

* Incorrect or missing functions
* Interface errors
* Errors in data structures or external database access
* Behavior or performance errors
* Initialization and termination errors

## Definitions
**black box testing:** Testing, either functional or non-functional, without reference to the internal structure of the component or system.
**black box test design technique:** Procedure to derive and/or select test cases based on an analysis of the specification, either functional or non-functional, of a component or system without reference to its internal structure.

## Example
A tester, without knowledge of the internal structures of a website, tests the web pages by using a browser; providing inputs (clicks, keystrokes) and verifying the outputs against the expected outcome.

## Levels of testing
Black Box Testing method is applicable to the following levels of software testing:

* Integration Testing
* System Testing
* Acceptance Testing
The higher the level, and hence the bigger and more complex the box, the more black-box testing method comes into use.

## Techniques
Following are some techniques that can be used for designing black box tests.

* **Equivalence Partitioning:** It is a software test design technique that involves dividing input values into valid and invalid partitions and selecting representative values from each partition as test data.
* **Boundary Value Analysis:** It is a software test design technique that involves the determination of boundaries for input values and selecting values that are at the boundaries and just inside/ outside of the boundaries as test data.
* **Cause-Effect Graphing:** It is a software test design technique that involves identifying the cases (input conditions) and effects (output conditions), producing a Cause-Effect Graph, and generating test cases accordingly.

## Advantages
* Tests are done from a userâ€™s point of view and will help in exposing discrepancies in the specifications.
* Tester need not know programming languages or how the software has been implemented.
* Tests can be conducted by a body independent from the developers, allowing for an objective perspective and the avoidance of developer-bias.
* Test cases can be designed as soon as the specifications are complete.
## Disadvantages
* Only a small number of possible inputs can be tested and many program paths will be left untested.
* Without clear specifications, which is the situation in many projects, test cases will be difficult to design.
* Tests can be redundant if the software designer/developer has already run a test case.
